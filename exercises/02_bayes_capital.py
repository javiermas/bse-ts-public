    # Exercise 02: The Brief

    Six months ago you were forecasting grid load for the Department of Energy of Stochastia.
    Your capacity report circulated further than you expected — **Bayes Capital** reached out shortly after and offered you a role
    on their quantitative research team.

    Your first week. Your manager drops a dataset on your desk:

    > *"We're analyzing a new financial product to sell to one of our clients.
    > Our client wants to understand what is the expected performance of the product, as well as
    > our confidence around it.
    > Take a look at the data I shared with you. I need a twelve-month forecast with a 95% prediction interval at each step. Use what you know."*

    The data is in `y`. You should use the last 12 months as hold out for evaluation.

    Your task:
    1. Explore the data. What are the main patterns?
    2. Fit a simple OLS linear model that captures the structure identified in your EDA. Forecast 12 months ahead with 95% prediction intervals at each step,
    and plot your forecast against the held-out test period.
    3. Interpret the results of the models: the coefficients, the point estimates and the CIs. What do you see?
